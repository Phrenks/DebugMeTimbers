DebugMeTimbers is a debugging library that will be, once completed, available for:
- PHP
- C++
- C
- Java

Purpose
-------

Very often, while developing, one must print messages or run functions that will
later have to be commented out or deleted once the release version is made. Even
during development, one has to switch back and forth often to run those specific
debugging pieces of code. This library allows for that code to be organized and
easy to toggle on and off.
